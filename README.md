## About
Webapp for text based ERD schema creation. The app allows users to create JavaScript scripts and execute them based on the schema. Contains built-in scripts and user created scripts shared as comments.

### Main drawing view
Everything needed to visualise database tables. Create/read/update/delete tables, export schema as PNG or TXT, import TXT schemas, change zoom level or navigate schema. Also supports undo/redo functionalty.

## Todo
* Script tagging and filtering
* Add hidden semantic description field on table row fields to allow better documentation generation. Saving has to be reworked to include extra values on top of the schema
* More scripts (documentation, code generation, ORM)
